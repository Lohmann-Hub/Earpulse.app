# Terms of Service for Earpulse

**Last Updated:** January 2026

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By downloading, installing, or using the Earpulse mobile application (the "App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.

The App is provided by Maximilian Lohmann ("we," "our," or "us"). These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and us regarding your use of the App.

## 2. Description of the App

Earpulse is a heart rate tracking application for iOS that uses the biometric sensors in AirPods Pro 3 to display real-time heart rate data, record sessions, and integrate with Apple HealthKit. The App is designed for personal health and fitness tracking only.

## 3. License to Use

Subject to your compliance with these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to download, install, and use the App on your own Apple-branded devices for personal, non-commercial use. You may not sublicense, sell, rent, lease, or distribute the App or any part of it.

## 4. Restrictions

You agree not to:

- Use the App for any illegal purpose or in violation of any applicable laws
- Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or attempt to derive the source code of the App
- Remove, alter, or obscure any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary notices
- Use the App to collect or harvest any data from the App or its users beyond your own usage data
- Interfere with or disrupt the App, its servers, or networks
- Use the App in any way that could harm, disable, or overburden our or Apple's systems

## 5. Intellectual Property

The App, including its design, code, graphics, and all content (excluding user-generated data), is owned by Maximilian Lohmann and is protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws. You do not acquire any ownership rights by using the App. All rights not expressly granted are reserved.

## 6. Health and Medical Disclaimer

**Important:** The App is for general wellness and fitness purposes only. It is **not** a medical device and is **not** intended to:

- Diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or medical condition
- Replace professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment
- Monitor or manage any medical condition

Heart rate measurements from wearable sensors (including AirPods Pro 3) may not be accurate in all situations. Always seek the advice of a qualified healthcare provider with any questions regarding a medical condition. Never disregard professional medical advice or delay seeking it because of something you have seen or inferred from the App.

If you have a medical condition, cardiovascular concerns, or are taking medication that affects heart rate, consult your doctor before relying on the App for any health-related decisions.

## 7. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law:

- The App is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied
- We do not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of harmful components
- In no event shall we be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages (including loss of data, loss of profits, or personal injury) arising out of or related to your use of the App
- Our total liability for any claims arising from or related to the App shall not exceed the amount you paid to use the App (if any), or, if no amount was paid, zero

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain warranties or liabilities, so some of the above may not apply to you.

## 8. Termination

You may stop using the App at any time by deleting it from your device. We may suspend or terminate your access to the App (or any part of it) at any time, with or without cause or notice, if we believe you have violated these Terms or for any other reason at our discretion.

Upon termination, your right to use the App ceases immediately. Sections that by their nature should survive (including Intellectual Property, Limitation of Liability, and Governing Law) will survive termination.

## 9. Changes to the Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of material changes by:

- Posting the updated Terms in the App or on our website
- Updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document
- Providing in-app notice where appropriate

Your continued use of the App after such changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the new Terms, you must stop using the App.

## 10. Third-Party Services

The App uses Apple services (including HealthKit, iCloud/CloudKit). Your use of those services is subject to Apple's terms and policies. We are not responsible for Apple's services or their availability.

## 11. Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Germany, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any disputes arising from these Terms or the App shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Germany (to the extent permitted by law).

## 12. Severability

If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.
